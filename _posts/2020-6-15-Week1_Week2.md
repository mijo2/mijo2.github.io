title: GSoC'20 - Week 1 and Week 2
---

This blog contains the details of the work that I have done for week 1 and week 2. Since my college decided to take open book examinations online in the first week of June, I was busy in the first week with my exams. Hence, this post contains the work that I have done for both the weeks together.

# Linear, n equations, Order 1, Type 2: Constant coefficient non-homogeneous solver

Lets look at the systems of this type:
```
X' = A*X + b(t)
```

This system looks very similar to the system described in type. Without going into too much detail, its easy to get the solution for the above system:
```
X' - AX = b(t)
exp(-A t) X' - exp(-A t) A X = exp(-A t)
```
Now, its important to note that `A` commutes with `exp(-A t)`, so `exp(-A t) A X = A exp(-A t) X`:
```
exp(-A t) X' - A exp(-A t) X = exp(-A t) * b(t)
```
The lhs is just `d/dt{ exp(-A t) X }`. Hence,
```
d/dt{ exp(-A t) X } = exp(-A t) b(t)
```
Integrating on both the sides gives:
```
exp(-A t) X = integration( exp(-A t)*b(t), t ) + C
X = exp(A t)( integration( exp(-At)*b(t), t) + C )
```
Computing exponential of `A t` is expensive but we can use the jordan form method that we used for the solution for type 1.
```
exp(A t) = P * expJ * P.inv
exp(-A t) = P * expJ.inv * P.inv
```
Hence:
```
X = P * expJ * (integration( expJ.inv * P.inv * b(t), t ) + C)
```
Lets see the workings of this solution with the help of an example:
```
In [55]: eq1                                                                                                                                                                                                
Out[55]: 
⎡d                           d                          ⎤
⎢──(f(x)) = f(x) + g(x) + 5, ──(g(x)) = -f(x) - g(x) + 7⎥
⎣dx                          dx                         ⎦
```
This is a constant coefficient non-homogeneous system. Lets get the coefficient matrices for finding the solution:
```
In [35]: (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eq1, [f(x), g(x)], x, 1)                                                                                                                                        

In [36]: A1                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Out[36]: 
⎡1  0⎤
⎢    ⎥
⎣0  1⎦

In [37]: A0                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Out[37]: 
⎡1   1 ⎤
⎢      ⎥
⎣-1  -1⎦

In [38]: b                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Out[38]: 
⎡5⎤
⎢ ⎥
⎣7⎦
```
We need only `A0` and `b` for the solution. Now, we have to compute `P` and `expJ`. 

Note: The method used here to compute the jordan normal form is not how its actually computed. There is a function created in the module before this GSoC project named `matrix_exp_jordan_form` specially designed to compute the exponential `exp(A t)` for faster computatiion given the fact that constant coeffcieint systems are very commonly in use.

```
In [40]: P, J = A0.jordan_form()                                                                                                                                                                            

In [41]: P                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Out[41]: 
⎡1   1⎤
⎢     ⎥
⎣-1  0⎦

In [42]: J                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Out[42]: 
⎡0  1⎤
⎢    ⎥
⎣0  0⎦

In [43]: expJ = exp(J*x)
```

Now, we will use `P`, `expJ` and `b` to get the solution vector:
```
In [56]: sol_vector = P * expJ * ( integrate(expJ.inv() * P.inv() * b, x) + C) 

In [57]: sol = [Eq(f, s) for f, s in zip([f(x), g(x)], sol_vector)] 

In [59]: sol                                                                                                                                                                                                
Out[59]: 
⎡               2                                              2                      ⎤
⎣f(x) = C₁ - 6⋅x  - 7⋅x + (C₂ + 12⋅x)⋅(x + 1), g(x) = -C₁ + 6⋅x  - x⋅(C₂ + 12⋅x) + 7⋅x
```
This is the solution for the system. Lets validate this solution:
```
In [58]: checksysodesol(eq1, sol)                                                                                                                                                                           
Out[58]: (True, [0, 0])
```

# Other tasks

Other than adding the above solver, some effort was made for simplifying the solutions by addition of two methods given below.

The simplification methods are:

1. ```simpsol``` method: Makes a polynomial like expression from the exponential terms which are factorized, simplifies the rational terms in all the coefficients of the made up polynomial.

2. ```solsimp``` method: Simplifies the expression using powsimp, divides the expression into terms that are dependent and independent of the independent variable(`t`), carries out rational term simplification for the part of the expression independent of `t`, factorizes the power of the exponential terms of the expression dependent on `t` and adds both these simplified parts up.

These methods were checked throughly and analysis was also done for these methods. The link for the analysis is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZ3U1DComPEpMVXOkSJl5ThxUno16aQ78lonC8sSbos/edit?usp=sharing). 

In the upcoming week, the target is to complete the work for type 4 solver.
