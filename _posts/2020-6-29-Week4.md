title: GSoC'20 - Week 4
---

The below are the things done in WEEK 4:

1. The PR related to Type 4 solver was merged. This PR was merged sooner than the other PRs since
   this was the fourth time of adding a new solver.
2. It was observed that there are a lots of repetitive lines in the four solvers added. Since it was
   essential to work on them separately so that each of the solvers are tested out thoroughly and
   worked upon individually. Now, these solvers are combined in the latest PR and this solver's 
   API is designed so that even an end user can use the solver directly without going through the
   matching function.
     
The target for WEEK 5 is to get the current PR merged as well as complete the evaluations properly.
