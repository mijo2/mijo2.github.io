I was lucky enough to pass the first evaluation of GSoC'20. I would like to thank my mentors for their constant support and valuable feedback. 

Aside the first evaluations, this week, the main work done was combining the solvers introduced previously in this project and finally making a version of
`dsolve_system`, which will be able to take a system of ODEs as an input and solve it appropriately using solvers added. 

PR [#19653](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19653 "#19653"):

This PR combined _linear_neq_order1_type1-4 solvers into `linodesolve`. A function that takes coefficient matrix, independent variable and non-homogeneous term(if any), and matches the appropriate solution to solve for the type of system passed. 

Lets define a test system to test our `linodesolve` function on:
```
In [2]: f, g = symbols('f g', cls=Function) 
   ...: eqs = [ 
   ...: Eq(f(x).diff(x), f(x) + y*g(x)),  
   ...: Eq(g(x).diff(x), f(x)*y - g(x))] 
   ...: funcs = [f(x), g(x)]
```
As you can see, the above system has the coefficient matrix defined below:
```
In [3]: M = Matrix([[1, y], [y, -1]])
```

Since, we know that the system that we have is linear, order 1, constant coefficient and non-homogeneous, the type of the system is "type1" and we can pass the appropriate arguments to get the solution for the system of ODEs:
```
In [4]: sol_vector = linodesolve(M, x, type="type1") 
In [6]: sol_vector                                                                                                                                                                                          
Out[6]: 
⎡              ________              ________                                        ⎤
⎢             ╱  2                  ╱  2                 ________            ________⎥
⎢        -x⋅╲╱  y  + 1          x⋅╲╱  y  + 1            ╱  2                ╱  2     ⎥
⎢  C₁⋅y⋅ℯ                 C₂⋅y⋅ℯ                   -x⋅╲╱  y  + 1        x⋅╲╱  y  + 1 ⎥
⎢- ──────────────────── + ───────────────────, C₁⋅ℯ               + C₂⋅ℯ             ⎥
⎢       ________               ________                                              ⎥
⎢      ╱  2                   ╱  2                                                   ⎥
⎣    ╲╱  y  + 1  + 1        ╲╱  y  + 1  - 1                                          ⎦

```
We can test the solution for the above system. The correctness of the solutions of the four types introduced is nothing to be worried since it is well tested in the file `sympy/solvers/ode/tests/test_systems.py`.
