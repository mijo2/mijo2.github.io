title: GSoC'20 - Week 8
---

This week's work involved working on two PRs, one related to connected components and other for adding the functionality of reducing higher order system to a first order system.

# [Connected Components](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19762)
Details about this PR was given in the previous week's blog post. This week, the target was to get this merged which was done. Two main things were achieved this week for this PR:
1. Adding a simplified version of the code for dividing system of ODEs.
2. Updating the test cases since the solutions can have any order. This was done using frozenset, set and tuples to make the answers to test cases order independent so that they can be verified in any Python version.

# [Higher Order to First Order reduction](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19838)

This week, bare bones of the functionality is added. Its still under production and thus, more details about the technique will be added in a future blog post. A brief working of this blog post is given below:
For reducing a higher order system into a first order system, we introduce more dependent variables and more number of ODEs. 

More details about the working of this technique will be shown in the next week's blog post when the technique's working is finalised.
