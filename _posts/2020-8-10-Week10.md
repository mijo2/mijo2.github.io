title: GSoC'20 - Week 10
---

This week's work involved extending the capabilities of `dsolve_system` by introducing a method to solve a particular form of second order system of ODEs.

# Linear 2 equations, Order 2, Type 5, 8, 11

These systems are of the following format:

```
X'' = A(t)*(t*X' - X) + b(t)
```

Here, `X` is a vector of dependent variables, `A(t)` is a coefficient matrix and `b(t)` is the non-homogeneous term.
To solve the above system for any number of equations, we will make a substitution and reduce the above system into a first order system of ODEs:

```
U = t*X' - X => U' = t*X''
```

Hence, the system becomes:
```
U' = t*A(t)*U + t*b(t)
```

Let's say we solve for `U`. Now, we can easily solve for `X` by leveraging the substitution:
```
t*X' - X = U(t)
```

This is a solvable system of ODEs. This solution was implemented in this week and the old solvers that are being covered by this substitution are removed.

For the next week, a number of solvers are going to be implemented.
